Prompt: What are the closest critical structures to this instrument?

Query: What is the next surgical phase?
Response:
Model: Surgical-VQA
Prompt: What is the next surgical phase?

Query: How long left for this step?
Response:
Model: Surgical-VQA
Prompt: How long left for this step?

Query: How many seconds have passed since the suction tube first came into view?
Response:
Model: Surgical-VQA
Prompt: How many seconds have passed since the suction tube first came into view?

Query: Show the regions where I should avoid drilling while I remove the sellar floor.
Response: 
Step1: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the left and right internal carotid arteries and the optic nerves in the current endoscopic frame.
Step2: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay a ‘no-drill’ mask that extends 3 mm around the segmented ICAs and optic nerves.

Query: Predict whether continued drilling at this speed will breach the sella within the next minute.
Response:
Step1: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the sella region and quantify remaining bone thickness along the drill trajectory.
Step2: Model: Visual-Question-Answering
Prompt: Using current drilling rate, extrapolate time to full-thickness breach; warn if ≤60 s.


Query: Estimate how many more bites with the Kerrisons I need before the clival recess is fully exposed—without getting too close to the left carotid.
Response:
Step1: Model: Detect-Instrument
Prompt: Detect and track the Kerrisons rongeur tip in real time.
Step2: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the clival recess and the left carotid artery.
Step3: Model: Visual-Question-Answering
Prompt: Calculate remaining bony distance to complete exposure while maintaining ≥2 mm clearance from the left carotid; output estimated number of rongeur bites.

Query: Highlight any residual pituitary adenoma that still impinges on the optic chiasm according to the MRI.
Response:
Step1: Model: Segment-MRI
Prompt: Segment pituitary adenoma and optic chiasm on the pre-op MRI.
Step2: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment residual tumor tissue in the live view.
Step3: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay areas where live tumor segmentation overlaps or contacts the MRI-defined optic chiasm.

Query: Before I insert the micro-Doppler, show me a safe entry line that avoids both carotids and the pituitary stalk.
Response:
Step1: Model: Segment-MRI
Prompt: Segment bilateral ICAs and the pituitary stalk on MRI.
Step2: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment current endoscopic view of the same structures.
Step3: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay a recommended Doppler entry line that maintains at least 2 mm clearance from all segmented structures.
