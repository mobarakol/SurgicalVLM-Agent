Query: Visualize critical landmarks to avoid during nasal corridor entry?
Response:
Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the Sella, Left Carotid, and Right Carotid?

Query: I need to avoid vascular structures during dissection. What should I visualize?
Response: 
Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the Left Carotid and Right Carotid arteries?

Query: Help me to assess tumor margins for resection planning?
Response:
Model: Segment-MRI
Prompt: Segment the Pituitary Adenoma and its boundaries?

Query: Is the Internal Carotid Artery compressed by the tumor?
Response:
Model: Segment-MRI
Prompt: Segment the Pituitary Adenoma and Internal Carotid Artery.

Query: Show me regions where I should avoid drilling while I remove the sellar floor.
Response: 
Step1: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the left and right internal carotid arteries and the optic nerves in the current endoscopic frame.
Step2: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay a ‘no-drill’ mask that extends 3 mm around the segmented ICAs and optic nerves.

Query: Check if the planned surgical path avoids the internal carotid arteries effectively?
Response:
Step 1: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the internal carotid arteries from the surgical view?
Step 2: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay the segmented internal carotid arteries and planned surgical trajectory?

Query: Show me the critical anatomical landmarks around the instrument I'm currently using to confirm I'm not near the internal carotid artery?
Response:
Step 1: Model: Detect-Instrument
Prompt: Identify and localize the current surgical instrument?
Step 2: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay internal carotid artery around the detected instrument location?

Query: Based on the MRI scans, can you confirm if my pituitary rongeurs are accurately positioned within the adenoma boundary?
Response:
Step 1: Model: Detect-Instrument
Prompt: Locate the pituitary rongeurs?
Step 2: Model: Segment-MRI
Prompt: Segment the pituitary adenoma on the MRI image?

Query: Estimate how many more bites with the Kerrisons I need before the clival recess is fully exposed—without getting too close to the left carotid.
Response:
Step1: Model: Detect-Instrument
Prompt: Detect and track the Kerrisons rongeur tip?
Step2: Model: Segment-Video
Prompt: Segment the clival recess and the left carotid artery.
Step3: Model: Visual-Question-Answering
Prompt: Calculate remaining bony distance to complete exposure, and output estimated number of rongeur bites.

Query: I'm currently using pituitary rongeurs; am I clearly within the adenoma margins based on preoperative imaging, and what anatomical structures are nearby?
Response:
Step 1: Model: Instrument Detection
Prompt: Detect the location of the pituitary rongeurs?
Step 2: Model: MRI Segmentation
Prompt: Segment the pituitary adenoma from preoperative MRI?
Step 3: Model: Overlaying
Prompt: Overlay anatomical landmarks around the detected instrument?
